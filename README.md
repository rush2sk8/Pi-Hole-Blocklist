# Pi-Hole-Blocklist
![Generate pihole.txt](https://github.com/rushadantia/Pi-Hole-Blocklist/workflows/Generate%20pihole.txt/badge.svg)

This repository will auto-generate a `pihole.txt` which is a unique concatination of all blocklists found in `urls.txt`. This file is auto generated by a GitHub Actions workflow and will be updated upon changes to `urls.txt`. To update `pihole.txt` make a PR with a new url in `urls.txt` and `pihole.txt` will be updated to reflect the changes.


# Create the list manually

```bash
(xargs <urls.txt curl) | sort | uniq | sed -e 's/^[ \t]*//' |  grep -Ev '^#|^-' > pihole.txt
```
